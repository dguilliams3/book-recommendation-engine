# Student Profile Worker

## Overview

The **Student Profile Worker** is a real-time profile aggregation service that builds comprehensive student reading profiles from historical checkout data. This service demonstrates sophisticated event-driven data processing, intelligent reading level categorization, and optimized caching strategies for personalized recommendation systems.

## Architecture & Core Responsibilities

### **Primary Functions**
- **Real-Time Profile Aggregation**: Constructs student reading profiles from checkout history with sub-second latency
- **Difficulty Band Classification**: Intelligent categorization of reading preferences across standardized difficulty bands
- **Profile Cache Management**: Maintains high-performance cached profiles for instant recommendation access
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Responds to checkout events with immediate profile recalculation and cache updates

### **Advanced Profile Construction Pipeline**

#### **Dynamic Reading Level Categorization**
```python
# Intelligent difficulty band mapping from numerical reading levels
def level_to_band(reading_level: float | None) -> str | None:
    if reading_level is None:
        return None
    if reading_level <= 2.0:
        return "beginner"          # Pre-K to Grade 2
    if reading_level <= 4.0:
        return "early_elementary"  # Grades 3-4
    if reading_level <= 6.0:
        return "late_elementary"   # Grades 5-6
    if reading_level <= 8.0:
        return "middle_school"     # Grades 7-8
    return "advanced"              # High school+
```

**Classification Strategy**:
- **Multi-Source Mapping**: Uses explicit difficulty_band or computed from reading_level
- **Educational Alignment**: Bands correspond to standard educational grade groupings
- **Graceful Fallback**: Handles missing data with intelligent level inference
- **Standardized Vocabulary**: Consistent categorization across the entire system

#### **Histogram-Based Profile Generation**
```python
# Statistical aggregation of student reading preferences
async def build_profile(student_id: str) -> dict:
    # Fetch complete checkout history with book metadata
    # Map reading levels to standardized difficulty bands
    # Generate frequency histogram of reading preferences
    # Return normalized profile representation
    pass
```

**Profile Features**:
- **Preference Distribution**: Frequency analysis of difficulty band preferences
- **Historical Completeness**: Incorporates entire checkout history for comprehensive profiling
- **Null-Safe Processing**: Robust handling of incomplete or missing book metadata
- **Statistical Representation**: Counter-based histograms for efficient profile comparison

## Event-Driven Processing Architecture

### **Real-Time Checkout Processing**
```python
# Immediate profile updates triggered by checkout events
async def handle_checkout(event: dict):
    student_id = event.get("student_id")
    event_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Unique traceability ID
    
    # Rebuild complete student profile
    histogram = await build_profile(student_id)
    
    # Update cached profile with atomic operation
    await update_profile_cache(student_id, histogram, event_id)
    
    # Publish profile change event for downstream consumers
    await publish_event(STUDENT_PROFILE_TOPIC, StudentProfileChangedEvent(student_id=student_id))
```

**Event Processing Features**:
- **Single-Event Triggers**: Each checkout immediately triggers profile recalculation
- **Complete Profile Rebuild**: Ensures profiles always reflect current student preferences
- **Atomic Cache Updates**: Prevents partial or inconsistent profile states
- **Event Traceability**: UUID-based tracking for audit trails and debugging

### **Downstream Event Publication**
```python
# Coordinated event publishing for dependent services
prof_evt = StudentProfileChangedEvent(student_id=student_id)
await publish_event(STUDENT_PROFILE_TOPIC, prof_evt.model_dump())
```

**Event Coordination**:
- **Similarity Worker Triggers**: Profile changes trigger student similarity recalculation
- **Recommendation Cache Invalidation**: Ensures fresh recommendations reflect updated preferences
- **Analytics Pipeline Updates**: Feeds profile changes to reporting and analytics systems
- **Audit Trail Maintenance**: Creates comprehensive change history for compliance

## High-Performance Profile Caching

### **Optimized Database Storage**
```python
# Efficient profile persistence with conflict resolution
async def update_profile_cache(student_id: str, histogram: dict, event_id: str):
    await conn.execute("""
        INSERT INTO student_profile_cache VALUES($1, $2, $3)
        ON CONFLICT(student_id) DO UPDATE SET histogram=$2, last_event=$3
    """, student_id, json.dumps(histogram), event_id)
```

**Storage Optimization**:
- **JSON Document Storage**: Efficient serialization of histogram data structures
- **Upsert Operations**: Atomic insert-or-update for concurrent access safety
- **Event Correlation**: Links cache entries to originating events for traceability
- **Primary Key Optimization**: Single-field primary key for maximum query performance

### **Profile Data Structure**
```python
# Example profile histogram for a student
student_profile = {
    "beginner": 2,           # 2 books at beginner level
    "early_elementary": 8,    # 8 books at early elementary level
    "late_elementary": 15,    # 15 books at late elementary level
    "middle_school": 3,       # 3 books at middle school level
    "advanced": 1             # 1 book at advanced level
}
```

**Profile Characteristics**:
- **Frequency Representation**: Simple count-based preference modeling
- **Sparse Encoding**: Only includes difficulty bands with actual checkouts
- **Fast Serialization**: JSON format enables rapid cache operations
- **Recommendation Ready**: Direct consumption by recommendation algorithms
