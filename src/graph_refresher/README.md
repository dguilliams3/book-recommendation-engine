# Graph Refresher Service

## Overview

The **Graph Refresher Service** is a sophisticated background processor that maintains the student similarity graph through advanced machine learning algorithms and event-driven updates. This service demonstrates expert-level implementation of similarity computation, pgvector optimization, and debounced event processing.

## Architecture & Core Responsibilities

### **Primary Functions**
- **Similarity Matrix Computation**: Generates high-quality student similarity graphs using weighted embedding algorithms
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Responds to real-time book additions with debounced graph refresh triggers
- **Scheduled Processing**: Maintains nightly refresh cycles for comprehensive graph recalculation
- **pgvector Integration**: Leverages PostgreSQL's vector extension for efficient nearest-neighbor searches

### **Advanced Graph Processing Pipeline**

#### **Phase 1: Temporal Event Aggregation**
```python
# Half-life weighted checkout analysis
def half_life_weight(days: int) -> float:
    return 0.5 ** (days / S.half_life_days)

# 4x half-life window for comprehensive student behavior analysis
window_start = date.today() - timedelta(days=S.half_life_days * 4)
```

**Temporal Weighting Strategy**:
- **Recency Bias**: Recent checkouts weighted exponentially higher than historical data
- **Decay Function**: Configurable half-life (default: 30 days) for optimal recommendation freshness  
- **Window Optimization**: 4x half-life window captures sufficient historical context

#### **Phase 2: Weighted Token Generation**
```python
# Proportional token repetition for embedding weight approximation
for sid, pairs in tokens.items():
    doc = " ".join(t * max(1, round(w * 10)) for t, w in pairs)
    docs.append(doc or "no_history")
```

**Embedding Strategy**:
- **Token Repetition**: Difficulty bands repeated proportional to checkout frequency
- **Weight Amplification**: 10x multiplier for granular weight representation
- **Fallback Handling**: "no_history" placeholder for new students without checkout data

#### **Phase 3: Vector Generation & Similarity Computation**
```python
# OpenAI embeddings with optimized batch processing
vectors = EMB.embed_documents(docs)

# pgvector similarity search with configurable threshold
await conn.execute("""
    CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS student_embeddings_vec_idx 
    ON student_embeddings USING ivfflat (vec vector_cosine_ops) 
    WITH (lists = 32)
""")
```

## Event-Driven Processing Architecture

### **Debounced Event Handling**
```python
# Intelligent event debouncing prevents unnecessary processing
_refresh_delay = 30  # seconds to wait after last event
_refresh_task: Optional[asyncio.Task] = None

async def debounced_refresh():
    global _refresh_task
    if _refresh_task and not _refresh_task.done():
        _refresh_task.cancel()  # Cancel previous task
    _refresh_task = asyncio.create_task(_delayed_refresh())
```

**Debouncing Benefits**:
- **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents cascade refreshes during bulk operations
- **Latency Optimization**: Batches multiple trigger events into single refresh cycle
- **System Stability**: Reduces computational load during high-frequency update periods

### **Event Source Integration**
```python
# Multi-topic Kafka consumption for comprehensive event coverage
async def handle_book_event(event_data: dict):
    logger.info("Received book added event", extra={"event": event_data})
    await debounced_refresh()
```

**Event Types Processed**:
- **BookAddedEvent**: Triggers similarity refresh when new books enter catalog
- **StudentsAddedEvent**: Updates embedding space for new student cohorts
- **CheckoutAddedEvent**: Real-time preference signal integration

## Advanced Similarity Algorithm

### **Multi-Dimensional Preference Modeling**
```python
# Weighted token aggregation with temporal decay
tokens = defaultdict(list)
for r in rows:
    d_band = r["difficulty_band"]
    days = (today - r["checkout_date"]).days
    w = half_life_weight(days)
    if d_band is not None:
        tokens[r["student_id"]].append((d_band, w))
```

**Preference Signals**:
- **Reading Difficulty**: Primary signal based on book complexity preferences
- **Temporal Patterns**: Checkout frequency and recency weighting
- **Genre Preferences**: Implicit genre signals through difficulty band clustering
- **Social Similarity**: Collaborative filtering through similar student identification

### **pgvector Optimization**
```python
# High-performance vector similarity with specialized indexing
CREATE INDEX student_embeddings_vec_idx 
ON student_embeddings USING ivfflat (vec vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 32)

# K-nearest neighbor search with cosine similarity
SELECT student_id, 1-(vec <=> src.vec) AS sim
FROM student_embeddings, src
WHERE student_id <> $1
ORDER BY vec <=> src.vec LIMIT 15
```

**Index Optimization**:
- **IVFFlat Algorithm**: Inverted file with flat compression for optimal query speed
- **Cosine Similarity**: Normalized similarity measure robust to preference intensity variations
- **List Parameter**: 32 lists provide optimal balance between index size and query performance

## Performance Characteristics

async def _wait_for_data(timeout_sec: int = 60):
    while time.perf_counter() - start < timeout_sec:
        cnt = await conn.fetchval("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkout")
        if cnt and cnt > 0:
            return True
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
    return False
```
